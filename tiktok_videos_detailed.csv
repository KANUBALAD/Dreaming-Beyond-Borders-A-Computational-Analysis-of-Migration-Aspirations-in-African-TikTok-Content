But let me tell you the truth… the transition wasn’t as smooth as I imagined. The systems were different, the expectations were new, and the culture—oh, the culture—was a whole new world. If you’re a new overseas nurse coming to join the NHS, especially from Ghana or any part of Africa, I want to share with you a few things that truly helped me adapt and feel at home here. These are simple, everyday things—but they made a big difference for me. And I believe they’ll help you too. 🙏🏽✨ 1. Ask Questions – Don’t Assume! In the beginning, I felt shy asking questions because I didn’t want to look like I didn’t know what I was doing. But the NHS is big on safe practice, and one of the safest things you can do is ask. Don’t be afraid to ask why a procedure is done a certain way, how to document something, or even where to find supplies. No one expects you to know everything. They’ll respect you more for being open and eager to learn. 🤝💬 2. Observe and Learn the System Before rushing to “do it the way we did it back home,” take time to watch how things are done in your department. Each ward has its rhythm. The more you observe, the more confident you’ll become in knowing how to work safely and efficiently. Adaptation starts with humility. 😌👀 3. Know Your Policies and Guidelines Yes, I know it sounds boring. But honestly, reading the Trust’s policies gave me a lot of confidence. Knowing what is expected from you as a nurse in the UK is empowering. It makes you proactive and protects your practice. 📚✅ 4. Make Good Use of Your Mentor You’ll be assigned a mentor or preceptor—please, use them well. Don’t wait for them to always come to you. Ask for feedback, let them know where you’re struggling, and allow them to guide you. They’ve been where you are now. Their support can shorten your learning curve. 🤝👩🏽‍⚕️👨🏼‍⚕️ 5. Listen to the Experience of Other Overseas Colleagues We’ve all come with different experiences, but there’s so much we can learn from one another. Find those who have been here a while and learn from their journey—what worked for them, what mistakes they made. Their wisdom can save you stress. 🌍🗣️ 6. Never Stop Learning – Stay Curious The NHS is always changing. New guidelines, new technology, new skills. So, always be willing to learn. Take every training opportunity seriously. Do short courses, improve your documentation, learn about leadership… The more you grow, the more valuable you become. 📖🧠 You won’t know everything in the first month. There’ll be days you’ll feel like giving up. But keep going 🌱💪🏾 If you’re an overseas nurse already working here, what helped you adapt? Share in the comments—let’s support one another. 💬🧡 #OverseasNurse #NHSJourney #NurseLifeUK",0,0,0
