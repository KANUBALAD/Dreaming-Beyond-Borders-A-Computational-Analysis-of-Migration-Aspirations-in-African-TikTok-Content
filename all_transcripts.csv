in clinical research in the UK. So I've had people ask me lots of questions about how
to rise in bands, and then similar questions about moving into a nursing specialty. Okay,
so I will start from, imagine you have written your OSCE, and then you have gained your pain,
you've done your supernumerary, that is working with someone or shadowing, and now you are
doing your own work by yourself when you go to work. Yes, make sure that you first of
all use complete your oral PACS competencies to be signed off for oral medication administration,
IV medication administration, then you focus on cannulation and venipuncture, because these
are the basics for working in any form of nursing."

then you come to UK to write OSCE. But before you leave Ghana, make sure you have all your
documents intact, your certificates, your transcripts and clinical hours. Very important.
There have been people who went through it without facing any challenges. Everything went
through smoothly. But there are others who got to NMC and NMC says that we don't recognize your
program. Go and bring transcripts for your school and we want a transcript in clinical hours.
So your school have to expand on all the programs you have done, the clinical hours you have
practiced to make sure it is at the same level with adult nursing, which it is just that you are
focused on community nursing. So make sure you gather all these documents
before you continue your journey to the UK."

the usual process, write OSCE, write CBT, write IELTS and you'll be able to practice in UK.
As well as Ireland, you go through their process and you'll be able to practice.
When it comes to US and Canada, you'll face similar challenges because like I explained with
the midwives, their program or their mental health program in US and Canada is also a specialty
program at the masters level. So as we speak now, NMC Ghana is not verifying mental health nurses
and midwives for CGFNS verification. So those are the challenges right now. I know there are ways
people are going about it. I will list some pages you can have a look at. They have more

all about our Ghana training. So the other day, I was just making a video explaining
how we are going to work about it. So if you have still not joined or if you still not
contacted the team to join, please do so. We are just starting the online training.
In the first week of June. So what we are going to do basically is to come down with
the team to train potential Oski candidates. Those doing self-sponsorship will be coming
in very soon to ride their Oski. So we are going to provide a very serene environment
that will help you practice effectively before you come to the UK and sit for the exams.
So please, it's a very cool deal. I'm coming down myself together with the team, experienced
NHS nurses who know the in-depth of Oski. So please make sure that you register if you
have not. Just as I said earlier, limited slots. We have a few. We just make it so
good for you to enjoy. Oski training in Ghana, the first ever. Please make sure you be part
of this medium one. It's going to be a very good one. I don't want to talk much. Just
come and experience it for yourself. So if you are doing self-sponsorship or if you know
someone who is doing this self-sponsorship and wants to ride the Oski very soon, we are
going to provide intensive Oski training both online and face-to-face in Ghana. In what?
Ghana. So please, let's make sure that we all join. I'm coming myself together with
my team to make sure that this is made a reality. So come. Just come. I posted flyers previously.
Just get them. Find out the details. Very cool deal. And then join us. Thank you very
much. Hi, my name is Chanto. I'm a registered nurse here in the UK. And then making sure
that our colleagues who came here or our colleagues even back home get their NMC licensing to
facilitate their process. That's our goal."

7135015684907584774.txt,"So you started working as a nurse in 2013. What was it like working as a nurse in Ghana?
Well, it was all cool when we started. Sometimes you go to work and you don't have the resources to work with.
What I mean by resources here is material, something, gloves and other stuff to work with.
In Ghana, as a nurse, you hold a fund for everyone, the doctors, the record department, the sumartists, everything.
And whenever something goes wrong, it falls back onto the nurse because you are closer to the patient.
And it wasn't kind of easy, but you could see that that was the job that you chose to do and just have to deliver when it comes to that.
Tell us about your most challenging day as a nurse in Ghana.
Well, I would say my most challenging day in Ghana was when we were called to go and help at one of our medical departments.
A kind of tragedy happened and people fell in a pit.
When they were brought to our department, a psychiatric unit or a hospital, we don't deal with mostly medical cases, except the minor ones.
We tried to sustain these people. We called in the ambulance.
It would be sad to know that when the ambulance came in, what they tried to tell us is that people had to pay some sort of money to transport them to, I think, to a hospital.
And we were like, come on, you don't even know these people.
And we rented our service without even taking anything from them because we have to save lives. That's what we are told to do.
It happened that when they also attempted to transport them to the regional hospital, then we called the referral hospital like, this is what we have, this is what we are dealing with.
Can you help? They said no. They didn't have any beds available.
We tried our possible beds later when they had tested. I think the information came back to us that they lost the people on their way to the hospital,
which was very sad. We are called to save lives. And for me, I think that needs to really improve in Ghana.
As compared to here, if I'm supposed to go out and take you around, you see ambulance services are around like over 10.
You walk in with an ambulance, you walk in with the police, and it's just a phone call. They will just come and pick you without even taking any of those of you.
But the system has been created in such a way that, like in Ghana, where you have your NHS number, your NHS number, they don't need to know your name.
They just need to know everything comes true. I think that was one of my saddest moments working at the NHS in Ghana.
See people lose their lives when actually they can be saved without any worries from any of us.
Okay, we'll talk briefly about, soon about where you are right now, but let's stay with the Ghana situation. What kind of nurse were you in Ghana?
I was a psychiatrist.
You were a psychiatrist. And when did you decide that you wanted to leave?
I think in 2019.
What pushed you to that decision?
Well, most of my colleagues left the show, but I felt like it wasn't real because we usually hear stories that people are going to abroad and are going to pursue this kind of process of going into this kind of career, and the late titan, and that is not true.
So I was kind of scared, but they keep calling on video and they were like, come on, you need to come here. It's all queer. You don't want to overwork yourself in Ghana.
Although it also has a disadvantage. Just come on. Just come and work.
Well, I must say I was so scared because I wasn't buying into it, but a lot of stories go on when people travel outside the country.
Okay, so when you got over your fear or the anxiety, what did you do? How did you get yourself out of the system abroad?
Yeah, so I must say that when I finally decided, I spoke to a few people who are also outside, like family people, and they were like, yeah, this is actually happening in the United Kingdom.
And then I believed I had to take this opportunity, this role, because they are there like citizens and they know what is happening.
It's enough, it's enough, because if I stay in Ghana, I'm not sure I'm going to make any future for myself and my family when I'm supposed to have one. I'm not going to make it. I just have to move ahead.
How much were you earning in Ghana in 2019?
In 2019, I'll tell you what, around 2,300.
Is this net or gross?
Net or gross?
Yes, it's net.
Net, so after taxes you're earning 2,000 thereabouts.
Yeah.
Tell us the process of how you got from Ghana to the UK. What did you do? What did you pay? Who did you see?
Okay, I must say the process was kind of smooth. It only takes you to write an English test, which is one of the accessible standards, what you call the out examples, which is organized by the British Council, and that's it.
You then move ahead and sort out the clearance from the Ministry of Health, and for the clearance, we know that when you pass out first, you need to set a number of years, which I over-served.
Like I must say, yes, I over-served because this is my ninth year of working as a nurse if I was supposed to be in Ghana.
So you sort the clearance, take it to a regulator, and then you register with the NMC UK. They will try and do a background check to confirm that you actually work as a nurse or working as a nurse to confirm everything.
Then they open another portal for you where you take an exam. This time, this exam is related to nursing, what we call the computer-based test, which is EDT for short.
You do a police check as well because they also want to take the security details of yourself into high efficiency to be sure they are not bringing in, sorry to say, a criminal into their country to destabilize their security.
So they do all these checks, and then when you pass it, they apply for something called a certificate of ownership. So ours is like a Tier 2 visa, like a federal skilled worker, so they apply for it for you.
When it comes true, that's when you get to use it to apply for your visa. I must say, it's not that hard. It's kind of a smooth process. Within the next three months, you should be able to do it. You're kind of serious and want to actually leave the country.
How much did it cost you, this whole process?
During my time when I was writing the out and downs of 1,800 Ghana cities, and that was it. The rest of it was catered for by whoever wanted to take me, because it's a kind of, should I say a competition?
It's a competition because most of the agencies, most of the hospitals, they lack their nurses. And so when you pass and you contact any of them, if you know, they will take it up for you.
Some of them will tell you, you can pay for it. When you come here, we'll give you back the money, and they truly do that.
Go ahead.
And if you have the money to do it yourself, or you don't have it, you contact them, they will pay for everything for you. And it pushes your process through faster.
Okay. So everything was done, your documents were great, you got your visa, you got on the plane. Do you remember the day you got on the plane?
Yeah, I do.
When was that?
I left Ghana on the 31st.
You have the date even down like that?
Yeah, I do. I can't forget.
Was that the first time you were flying?
That was my first time.
How did you feel when you got on the plane?
Well, let me share a bit of that experience. I think when we got on the plane, we were supposed to leave Koto Ka around 7.30 p.m.
Then we got on the plane and it was getting to 9.30, nobody was speaking to us, but we could see the plane moving, trying to get up.
Then I think one man who had been traveling for a long time, for him, had that experience.
So he was sitting by me and he was like, my man, the plane is trying hard to get up, it's not getting up.
I was like, come on, this thing can't happen. This is my first time.
I was like, yeah, that's what is happening because I've been traveling for a long time.
You can't see the plane moving and trying to get up.
I said, I can't see, but my man wasn't there.
He was like, yeah, that's what is happening.
He came to speak to us and they developed a fault in which he waited.
I was like, wow, why are you going to wait again?
But then, knowing what had happened, he just got up and we got through.
I did a transit, so we got to Tiki and then to school.
It's always scary, like people have been saying it.
I was just relaxed. I was trying to take in all the experience that counts as flying.
Were you praying?
Yeah, I did, actually. I called my pastor when it happened and he was like, come on, that's not going to happen.
Just relax and enjoy your moment.
Okay. Where was your destination? Where did you get to?
Where did you touch down at?
Yeah, so we touched down. We did transit and take in and go to Manchester,
which is actually a town now, a city I want to be because of what Manchester United is.
So we got there and then we were taken to Wales because here, like I said, the system works.
We were taken to Wales to go through a training because you are coming to a new country,
you have the policies and the system, you can't just go straight to work.
And then we went to Wales to go through a training before we were dispatched to our final site,
or what we call hospitals, to go and work.
So where exactly, which city are you working in?
I'm in Reading.
You are in Reading. What's it like being a nurse in your hospital?
Here, over here, it's like they hold you in high esteem.
And like if anything, you'll be consulted much.
They don't just go ahead and make certain decisions without you.
And it's like you hold the phone for them.
So whatever they want to do, they have to talk to you.
And although it comes with its own stress and disadvantages because in Ghana,
we used to work for eight hours, but over here, you work for about 12 hours.
But then you earn more. It's not like Ghana where a nurse takes this, a nurse takes that.
And then they've created the ladder for you.
If you want to upgrade yourself, it's not like you do the number of years before we promote you.
No. If you work, your web manager sees how you are working.
They can just talk to your hospital director and say, look, this guy is very good.
I want you to get promoted.
Within a few months or a year, you can see yourself at the top.
And they've created the development pathway for you.
They pay for a web shop for you."

As I start with the information I have here, I can confirm that I'm with the right patient.
Ash, do you have any allergies to food, to latex, to any form of medication?
It's me. Yeah, I'm allergic to penicillin. Oh, so sorry to hear that.
What happens when you take penicillin? I tend to have anaphylaxis. Oh, so sorry to hear that.
I can see you have a red band on your wrist. Can I please touch it? Yeah.
Alright, so you have penicillin and you have anaphylaxis, alright.
Ash, it's well documented here that you have these kind of reactions, okay?
So far as you are here, nobody is going to give you anything that contains penicillin. Are you happy about that?
Yes. Alright. So Ash, I'm here today to do a pain assessment on you.
Yeah, the doctor has sent me just to check your pain levels. Is it a convenient time for me to go ahead?
Did you want to use the washroom or something? No, okay.
Okay, so I just want to ask you just a few questions, okay?
Now, I want to ask you what brings about your pain or where is your pain located?
Alright, so my pain is around my chest and sometimes I feel very getting what I need to touch.
Okay, so sorry to hear that, alright. What is the quality of the pain? How does the pain look like?
Actually, it starts as a shooting pain, but sometimes it ends as a stomping pain. Oh, so sorry to hear that.
Now, I want to ask you, with regards to the pain, where does it move to?
Does the pain start from somewhere and ends up somewhere?
And do you think that the pain is moving? Oh no, this pain doesn't really move. It's stagnant.
It's just stable at one point and it's really, really painful.
I can't really do anything without getting the pain met. Okay, don't worry. That's why I'm here.
There's no such a pain, okay? Don't worry.
Now, with regards to the pain, do you think that it started today or when did the pain start?
Yeah, I woke up this morning and I felt that I really had chest pain when I was breathing."

Thank you for watching!"
7493825349193633029.txt,"Assuming you were an enrolled nurse from Ghana, currently living in the UK, but you are not
registered with the NMC of UK, if you studied a top-up nursing with the University of Derby
and you now have a degree in nursing, you will still need to use the overseas routes
to register with the NMC of UK.
I hope that is clearer.
I would also encourage you to discuss with the program leader at the university about
what your prospects are before you begin the journey.
That is letting them know what your goal is, which is to become a registered nurse in the UK
and confirm from them if the program will allow you to register with the NMC of UK
after you have completed it to ensure that the program is accredited and recognized by the NMC
of UK.
These are some key things to know.
The certificate of credit is additional study.
It doesn't shorten your BSc top-up, but it does open the door for you to enter into the
BSc top-up program.
You will need to balance work and study.
The course runs over 10 weeks, so plan your time well.
You will be assessed through reflective work and CPD planning, no big final exams.
What happens after the top-up?
Once you have completed the top-up degree, you will be eligible to register with the NMC
as a registered nurse and apply for band 5 or above nursing rules.
You can also progress towards specialist rules, leadership, or even nurse education.
If you are thinking about the access route or top-up degree, let me know in the comments."

7100869457081306373.txt,"Hi guys, this is your girl Abuna Mercedes. I hope you are doing good. Today I'm coming to show
you how to migrate to the UK as a nurse. So if you are a nurse degree or
diploma nurse, you are welcome to apply for a job and come to the UK and work as
a nurse and this is the process how you go about it. So you have to get an
up-to-date CV, make sure all gaps are filled, gaps in terms like maybe you've
been home for two years, you have to fill in that gap what you were doing. Mostly
they will need working experience that covers five years. You should also be a
registered nurse in your home country. Also, you have to
write your IELTS. So it's IELTS academic, UKVI academic and you
should be able to pass band 7.0 and above. So band 7.0 in all category, that's
listening, writing, reading and speaking but they will consider you band 6.5 in
writing. So make sure all your overall score is 7.0 in all the categories. This
is the UKNMC requirements. That is why they are
asking you to get band 7.0 if you want to come to the UK and work as a nurse.
After you finish your IELTS, you now have to register with the UKNMC online.
When you register with them, they will now send a link to the NMC in your home
country and they will clear you up. After they clear you up, you would have to write
the CBT exams, that is CBT exams and then after you write the CBT exams, you are
halfway through, you are good to go. Now we have to look for a job online and make
sure you look for a licensed employer, employer that has the license to sponsor
you. So there are NHS hospitals, private hospitals, care homes, hospitals that are
given a two-sponsorship visa, also known as the skilled worker visa. So if you get
a licensed sponsor, a sponsor that is a company that will sponsor you to come to
the UK and work as a nurse, they will now give you an offer letter, that is if you
meet all their requirements, they will give you an offer letter and if they
give you the offer letter, you have to sign, withdraw it, sign and send it back
to them. They will now apply for the CUS, which is called the Certificate of
Sponsorship for you and when the CUS comes, you are good to go. You need that
one to apply for your visa and the CUS, when it comes as well, they will ask you
to do a tuberculosis test, which have the address and the details of the company
or the location where you are going in it. So that is why you are supposed to
do the tuberculosis test as well, international driver's license if
required and after you finish everything, I have companies that sponsors and then
they can give you free visa, free accommodation. You can go on my Facebook
page, AbunaMesedeseUK, I've got some links there and I have that direct link.
You can follow me, like, comment and share and I'll see you later for part two."
7163278150607064322.txt,"done with the IELTS and then the OET, then you are ready to register with LMC-UK.
So with LMC-UK registration, you just go to their website, and then they will redirect
you to LMC online, where you can be able to start your registration process.
You will need your school certificate, whether it's a diploma or a degree, and then you will also need
the NMC Ghana certificate as well, and then you will need to ensure that your PIN is renewed and
updated, you know, and then from there you will be made to pay an amount of money for validation,
and then after paying that money for the validation, you have to come back to NMC Ghana,
and then with NMC Ghana, you also pay an amount again for validation as well. That is where
the clearance comes in, so that if you went to the university straight away, or you went to a
private nursing training school, you don't need a clearance. If you even went to a government
nursing training school and you were not sponsored, you will not need a clearance, but if you went to
the government training school and you were sponsored, you will need a clearance. Sometimes
what happens is that because NMC Ghana doesn't know which batch of here was not sponsored,
if you are even still a government worker, they will still tell you that you will need a clearance,
because they are not sure who..."

7340350046828825888.txt,"I'm a registered nurse from Ghana currently working in the UK. I'm currently a clinical research
nurse so I've had lots of people ask me about how to become a clinical research nurse in the UK.
Okay so I moved from Ghana to the UK and then I was working on the ward. I was in an orthopedics
ward for nine months I think yeah before I moved to clinical research.
So how did I move into clinical research? So in my previous videos which you can check
I talked about how to rise in brands making sure you are signed up for your oral parks,
IP competency parts, brain puncture, cannulation. So once you are done with these four
scales you move on to having signed up for ECG. Yes so you would have to know how to do an ECG
if you want to work in clinical research and then you have to take a course called
the good clinical practice. If you go to NIHR website this website you would find the good
clinical practice course over there so you take the course and then you will get a certificate
a GCP certificate because most of the research jobs they would ask for the GCP certificate and
it is one of the main things you need to do before you can work in research. Then after that
you have to weigh yourself. Do you want to be a research nurse or you want to move into clinical
research? So there are two different things clinical research nurses deliver the care.
We are at the end of we are in the middle of delivering the care. So research nurses work
together with doctors to recruit participants for their research and then they bring the
participants to read the clinical research nurses and then we go on to render the care. So we do
venipuncture cannulation ECG at different time points. We administer medications, oral medications
and intravenous medications but then they are not medications that have a license. They have not
been registered by MHRA yet so we call them IMPs, investigational medicinal products. They do not
have a license. They are mainly trials for new diseases that are out there without any cure
and we are still trying to find a cure for them. So they are mainly clinical trial medications.
So these are the basis for becoming a clinical research nurse. Once you take the course you go
online to track jobs, NHS jobs and then you start looking for jobs. In my next video I will talk
about what kind of jobs you should look out for."
